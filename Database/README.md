# Problem Statement

The exercise consists of building an app which allows searching for stocks on an Angel Broking coding challenge app. Users of the app should be able to type a search term into a text field and the app will display a list of suggested stocks with a checkbox.  


## The challenge requirements

API URL:- https://api.myjson.com/bins/6c3je search on username.
Your final solution should check against to ensure the following:
Create One blacklist either Database or text file  file in your project asset folder and add those items whose results are not found in the api.


if the search term matches or starts with anything found in the blacklist, no API call is performed.


If a search term is not found in the blacklist, there is an API call to lookup matches.


If the API returns no results, the search term is added to the blacklist.


Add the user selected stock in different watchlist fragment/activity.


There should be a button which helps users to go from search to watchlist and from watchlist to search fragment.


ANGEL BROKING API which exposes a method to initiate the API call to the search endpoint


Animation
Animtion URL:- https://dribbble.com/shots/8549063-Split-the-Bill-App
List Should scroll smoothly as shown in animation url.


On the swipe left from the item it should show the delete stock option..


Bonus
Note that this is not required and a good solution meeting the challenge requirements is enough to pass the exercise. But if you are you looking for opportunities to expand the problem to better highlight your areas of expertise and interests, here are some ideas:
Find opportunities to improve the UI.


Make the app work offline by displaying previous search results.


Test your solution.
